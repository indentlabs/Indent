          <h4>What is Notebook.ai?</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Most creatives have at least one old notebook lying around somewhere, full of old plots, interesting characters, monsters,
            enchanting locations, or a myriad of other margin-scribbled thoughts. Others have piles of old "plot idea"
            documents in their favorite cloud storage. Others still have their brilliant, rich worlds fermenting in their heads.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            <strong>
              Notebook.ai is a worldbuilding tool that organizes, saves, and helps in fully fleshing out your fictional worlds, your way.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Your digital notebook takes full advantage of being just that &mdash; digital. Instead of fitting notes in the margins of
            pages past, you'll always have space to expand every idea. Instead of reading backward in your notes to remember who gave your character a
            legendary sword, every little detail about them is organized and just a click away. You don't need to flip around
            the pages in your old notebook to jump from a character to their birthplace to other characters born there; every "link" between
            your ideas is a real link, and lets you click to jump from one to the next.
          </p>
        </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s8">
        <div>
          <h4>How do I use it?</h4>
          <p class="light">
            It's actually really easy. Just sign up and create something &mdash; anything &mdash; and you're doing it right.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Most users start by creating a universe to hold everything they create afterwards. You can call it your campaign's title,
            "My Universe", or whatever you want. You'll be prompted to enter a description and a few other questions, but everything's
            entirely optional.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Once you have a universe, try creating a character or two for your main characters. You'll notice the process of creating
            a notebook page is exactly the same regardless of what type of page you're creating. You click create, you're presented with a bunch of
            optional fields to fill out about it, and you're done. You can create a location for where your adventure takes place, and
            items for any relevant objects or trinkets in your plot.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Once you've got the basics, just expand outward for your campaign! Right now, there are nine different page types you can
            create in Notebook.ai.

          <h4>Separate your worlds with Universes</h4>
          <p class="light">
            In addition to the page types detailed above, you can also create <strong>Universes</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            You can think of a universe as a bucket of time or space: a literal universe, a world, a country, a time period, even just the park down the street &mdash; your universe contains everything related
            to the plot you're building, and lets you focus entirely on just what's relevant right now, even when you plan multiple campaigns or worlds in Notebook.ai.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            When you create a character, a location, or anything else within Notebook.ai, you'll be asked what universe it belongs to. When you visit that universe's page in your notebook later, you'll see everything inside it from one convenient place.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Once you've created a universe on Notebook.ai, you'll see a new dropdown in the top-left corner of every page. Selecting a universe from it will "lock" your notebook to that universe: you'll only see content from that universe, and anything new you create will automatically be added to it. You can unlock or switch universes at any time.

          <h4>Share your campaign with players with easy privacy rules</h4>
          <p class="light">
            By default, every notebook page you create is private, for your eyes only, and completely owned by you.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            However, if you're sharing a world or campaign with your players, you may want to give them access to the world they're playing
            in. We offer two different ways to share pages with players that should make it easy to use Notebook.ai with friends.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Every Notebook.ai page has a "share" button that, when clicked, gives you the option to toggle privacy for that page or the
            privacy of the universe it belongs to. You're given the URL to that page to share, and others can see what you see (but not
            edit!) by visiting the shareable URL. As long as either the page they're visiting <em>or</em> the universe it belongs to is
            public, they'll be able to see the page.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            If you decide to make a page or universe private later, you can simply toggle the same switch and your pages become immediately
            inaccessible to anyone other than yourself &mdash; even if they still have the URL.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Some GMs create separate universes for "treasure troves" of information (like bestiaries and reference material) they'd like to share with their players halfway through a campaign. This allows sharing your entire universe with players from the beginning, and then sharing a second universe whenever the players have earned it.

          <h4>Keep your players engrossed with a rich world of consistent details</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Having an in-depth reference while campaigning lets you quickly look up even the smallest of details when you need them and
            keep the flow of gameplay uninterrupted. You'll never again have to flip backward to find out what reward Simon promised, or what
            city you said Elise was from. Everything you need is organized and at your fingertips.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            If you're not the type to build your world out completely before playing, Notebook.ai can also be used during an active campaign
            for the same kind of references. Each time you introduce a new character, simply create a character page for them (it's fast!).
            When you describe anything about them, you can jot it down in its rightful place and you can then refer back to it later.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            And, of course, if the default fields don't cover every little detail of your world, you can always create new categories
            and fields on any content type, like "biggest weakness" on characters or "yet-to-be-discovered treasures" for locations.
            It's <em>your</em> world &mdash; track anything you want!
          </p>

          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: When you create a custom field for any page type, it's immediately available for all other pages of the same time. For
            example, creating a "worn accessories" field on Characters will add the field to <em>all</em> characters &mdash; both existing and
            not yet created.

          <h4>Upload images for inspiration or reference</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Whether you're in the initial idea stage or further along and looking to save reference material, Notebook.ai allows image
            uploads to any notebook pages you create.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            You'll notice that any images you upload are featured across the site, from your dashboard to individual notebook pages.
            In addition to a Gallery tab on content that shows off every image uploaded to it, you'll also see slideshows banners
            at the top of your notebook pages highlighting the images you upload &mdash; and you may even see a character peeking
            back at you from your dashboard from time to time!
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Free users start with 50MB of storage space that can be used to upload any size of image. Premium users are boosted an additional
            1GB of storage space. You can delete any image at any time to reclaim and reuse its space.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Uploading images is a great way to save the maps of your world. They're highlighted at the top of their Location page,
            and you can click to expand them to their full, original size at any time.

          <h4>Build family trees and organization hierarchies with ease</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Because Notebook.ai is <em>smart</em>, we help out whenever we can when you link two pages together.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Family trees are a great example of this. If you created a small family of three &mdash; say, Alice and Bob and their son
            Carl &mdash; you can link them together with each character's Family tab. The fields there allow you to select from other
            characters you've created in that universe and set relationships, like father, mother, sibling, spouse, or child.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            When you're editing Alice and say Bob's her spouse and Carl's her son, we automatically edit Bob and Carl's pages also.
            For Bob, we know (and save) that Alice is his spouse; and for Carl, we automatically detect what gender Alice is and note that
            Alice is his mother. It all happens automatically, so your family trees almost build themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            You'll see similar "deep linking" when creating Locations or Groups. Creating sub-groups will automatically create parent groups, alliances and rivalships will automatically save to all groups involved, and nesting locations within each other will automatically link back to the parent location as well.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: This linking happens automatically, and you can always click through linked pages (because they are, after all, links!) to
            verify that everything is linked properly.

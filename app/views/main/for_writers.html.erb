          <h4>What is Notebook.ai?</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Most writers have at least one old notebook lying around somewhere, full of old story ideas, interesting characters,
            enchanting locations, or a myriad of other margin-scribbled thoughts. Some writers have piles of old "story idea"
            documents in their favorite cloud storage. Others still have their brilliant, rich worlds fermenting in their heads.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            <strong>
              Notebook.ai is a worldbuilding tool that organizes, saves, and helps in fully fleshing out your fictional world, your way.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Your digital notebook takes full advantage of being just that &mdash; digital. Instead of fitting notes in the margins of
            pages past, you'll always have space to expand every idea. Instead of reading backward in your story to find out how old you
            said that one character was, every little detail about them is organized and just a click away. You don't need to flip around
            the pages in your old notebook to jump from a character to their birthplace to other characters born there; every "link" between
            your ideas is a real link, and lets you click to jump from one to the next.
          </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s8">
        <div>
          <h4>How do I use it?</h4>
          <p class="light">
            It's actually really easy. Just sign up and create something &mdash; anything &mdash; and you're doing it right.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Most users start by creating a universe to hold everything they create afterwards. You can call it your novel's title,
            "My Universe", or whatever you want. You'll be prompted to enter a description and a few other questions, but everything's
            entirely optional.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Once you have a universe, try creating a character or two for your main characters. You'll notice the process of creating
            a notebook page is exactly the same regardless of what you're creating. You click create, you're presented with a bunch of
            optional fields to fill out about it, and you're done. You can create a location for where your story takes place, and
            items for any relevant objects or trinkets in your story.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Once you've got the basics, just expand outward for your story! Right now, there are nine different page types you can
            create in Notebook.ai.

          <h4>Separate your worlds with Universes</h4>
          <p class="light">
            In addition to the page types detailed above, you can also create <strong>Universes</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="light">You can think of a universe
            as a bucket of time or space: a literal universe, a world, a country, a time period, even just the park down the street &mdash; your universe contains everything related to the plot you're building, and lets you focus entirely on just what's relevant right now, even when you plan multiple stories or worlds in Notebook.ai.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            When you create a character, a location, or anything else within Notebook.ai, you'll be asked what universe it belongs to. When you visit that universe's page in your notebook later, you'll see everything inside it from one convenient place.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Once you've created a universe on Notebook.ai, you'll see a new dropdown in the top-left corner of every page. Selecting a universe from it will "lock" your notebook to that universe: you'll only see content from that universe, and anything new you create will automatically be added to it. You can unlock or switch universes at any time.

          <h4>Build your world piece by piece with personalized writing prompts</h4>
          <p class="light">
            After you've created a few pages in Notebook.ai, you'll start to see the magic happening. On your dashboard, for example,
            you'll now have a new card asking questions about what you've created so far.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            If you've created a character, it might ask where that character was born. If you've created a city, it might ask how many
            people live there. If you've created a creature, it might ask how it hunts for food. It's a fun, bite-sized way to start
            thinking about your ideas from new angles and flesh out your world more fully.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            When you write an answer, it is automatically saved to that character &mdash; or location, or creature, or anything else it
            asked about &mdash; and you can see your answer alongside any other information you've saved on that content's notebook page.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Every question card will also have a "quick reference" tab, which shows you other information about your characters and
            other ideas that might help when answering the question. This reference is generated automatically from everything Notebook.ai knows
            about your universe.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Keep your readers engrossed with a rich world of consistent details</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Having an in-depth reference while writing lets you quickly look up even the smallest of details when you need them and then
            keep writing uninterrupted. You'll never again have to read backward to find out what shirt color Simon was wearing, or what
            city you said Elise was from. Everything you need is organized and at your fingertips.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            If you're not the type to build your world out completely before writing, Notebook.ai can also be used while writing for the
            same kind of reference. Each time you introduce a new character, simply create a character page for them (it's fast!). When
            you describe anything about them, you can jot it down in its rightful place and you can then refer back to it later.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            And, of course, if the default fields don't cover every little detail of your world, you can always create new categories
            and fields on any content type, like "biggest weakness" on characters or "tallest skyscraper" for locations. It's <em>your</em>
            world &mdash; track anything you want!
          </p>

          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: After you've built your universe, you can share it (or any individual pages in it) with others to get
            feedback. This can avoid embarassing mistakes that can manifest later in your writing like, "Why couldn't Harry Potter see Thestrals until book five?" or "Why didnâ€™t the fellowship of the ring just get the eagles to fly the ring to Mount Doom?"

          <h4>Upload images for inspiration or reference</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Whether you're in the initial idea stage or further along and looking to save reference material, Notebook.ai allows image
            uploads to any notebook pages you create.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            You'll notice that any images you upload are featured across the site, from your dashboard to individual notebook pages.
            In addition to a Gallery tab on content that shows off every image uploaded to it, you'll also see slideshows banners
            at the top of your notebook pages highlighting the images you upload &mdash; and you may even see a character peeking
            back at you from your dashboard from time to time!
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Free users start with 50MB of storage space that can be used to upload any size of image. Premium users are boosted an additional
            1GB of storage space. You can delete any image at any time to reclaim and reuse its space.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: Uploading images is a great way to save the maps of your world. They're highlighted at the top of their Location page,
            and you can click to expand them to their full, original size at any time.

          <h4>Build family trees and organization hierarchies with ease</h4>
          <p class="light">
            Because Notebook.ai is <em>smart</em>, we help out whenever we can when you link two pages together.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            Family trees are a great example of this. If you created a small family of three &mdash; say, Alice and Bob and their son
            Carl &mdash; you can link them together with each character's Family tab. The fields there allow you to select from other
            characters you've created in that universe and set relationships, like father, mother, sibling, spouse, or child.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            When you're editing Alice and say Bob's her spouse and Carl's her son, we automatically edit Bob and Carl's pages also.
            For Bob, we know (and save) that Alice is his spouse; and for Carl, we automatically detect what gender Alice is and note that
            Alice is his mother. It all happens automatically, so your family trees almost build themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="light">
            You'll see similar "deep linking" when creating Locations or Groups. Creating sub-groups will automatically create parent groups, alliances and rivalships will automatically save to all groups involved, and nesting locations within each other will automatically link back to the parent location as well.
          </p>
          <div class="tip card-panel blue lighten-5 light">
            Tip: This linking happens automatically, and you can always click through linked pages (because they are, after all, links!) to
            verify that everything is linked properly.

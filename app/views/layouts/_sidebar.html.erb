  <p>
    Image uploading has been our most-requested feature since launch. Now that I'm working full-time on
    Notebook.ai, I'm happy to say it took about a week to finish up &mdash; and now it's ready for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can upload images to any content from the "Gallery" tab while editing it.

  <p>
    Free users have 50MB of space, and premium users have a whopping 1GB.

      Because you were here at Notebook.ai's launch, <strong>we've quintupled your space from 50MB to 250MB. Thank you!</strong>

Votes are created the following ways:

- During the Referral release, each currently-premium user will be given 1 feature vote.
- Whenever a user signs up for Premium that hasn't signed up for Premium before, they are given 1 feature vote.
- Whenever a user that was referred by another user signs up for Premium for the first time,
  - the user that referred that user is given 2 additional feature votes
  - the user that signed up for Premium is given an additional feature vote (2 in total)

Votes are never destroyed/deleted, even when cancelling a Premium subscription. They are only ever "used" when voting, and can
only be used once per vote.

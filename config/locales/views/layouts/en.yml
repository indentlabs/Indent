        If you jump right in to creating things, an account will be created for
        you. As you flesh out characters and worlds, your ideas will be safe
        and sound under this account, which does not ever expire unless you
        delete it yourself.
      learnmore_p2_html: >
        At any time, you can change the account's login information, so if you
        make some good progress you can just create an account and
        <em>tada!</em> all of your ideas are private to your new account,
        always there for you.
